## PhD_CZTI_Code

(a) Calculate_T90_CZTI.py code:
Plotting CZTI light curve, the background subtraction is carried out using quadratic function. T90 is calculated using a cumulative counts plot and errors are estimated by propagating Poissonian error on a basic lightcurve.

(b) Compton_Events.py code:
Code selects useful double events based on neighbouring pixels and within 40 micro-sec time intervals. These events are useful for further polarisation estimation.
